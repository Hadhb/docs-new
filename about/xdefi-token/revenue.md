## Trading Activity 

XDEFI generates revenue from swaps and bridging (list of applications/platforms available [here](./routing-api#current-platforms-using-the-routing-api).
-> 75% of the net revenue generated from all swaps, bridging and staking are used to buy $XDEFI on the open market. These purchased tokens are rewarded to token holders who stake $XDEFI.
XDEFI swap fees range between 0.3% â€“ 0.5%.
We do not charge fees on swaps < US$300 in value.
Swaps fees via THORChain DEX aggregator are 0.3%.
Swap fees via other routes are 0.5% (41% less than the 0.85% charged at MetaMask and Phantom as of 15 May 2023).
This model creates a virtuous cycle for the $XDEFI token holders:
More XDEFI Wallet and Web App users means
Larger swap & bridge volume (and more fees earned), which means
Larger $XDEFI buybacks and greater rewards for $XDEFI stakers

## Staking Activity
XDEFI Technologies will implement staking within wallet throught partners during 2024.

While users will have the option to stake with the validator of their choice in the interface, the default validator will be a partner with whom commissions fees will be splitted.


## Liquidity Provision 
XDEFI Wallet has partnered with Portals.fi to implement single-sided liquidity provision directly from within its products. 

The swap fee will be 0.25%, . 

-> 75% of the net revenue will be used to buyback $XDEFI on the open market and the $XDEFI will be rewarded to stakers. 
Gas Abstraction 
XDEFI Wallet is introducing an innovative new feature that allows users to lock up stable coins to pay for transaction fees in a "gas tank." This reserve will enable quick and easy payment of transaction fees without the need for multiple transactions or disruptions in the flow of activity.
A fee will be charged when funds are deposited in stables into the gas tank (TBD).
